# WindTurbine-InteractiveSystem
Development of a QA system over a domain-specific knowledge graph for operations &amp; maintenance of wind turbines.
This repository contains supplementary resources for our paper "Graph Query Language Generation for Automated Question-Answering Over Knowledge Graph in Operations &amp; Maintenance of Wind Turbines" 

More details on the knowledge graph used for information retrieval based on user-provided queries can be found at https://github.com/joyjitchatterjee/XAI4Wind. (Chatterjee, J. and Dethlefs, N., “XAI4Wind: A Multimodal Knowledge Graph Database for Explainable Decision Support in Operations & Maintenance of Wind Turbines”, arXiv e-prints, 2020.)

# Acknowledgments
We acknowledge the publicly available Skillwind maintenance manual and ORE Catapult's Platform for Operational Data (POD) for the valuable resources used in development of this repository.
A subset of 102 SCADA features (with their names publicly available on POD) was used in developing the query templates. The maintenance actions segment is used to organise the information present in the Skillwind manual into a domain-specific ontology. Due to confidentiality reasons, we have not provided the numeric values and complete SCADA corpus, but only released information which is presently in the public domain in this repository. More information can be found in references (1) for the maintenance action manual and (2) for multiple other potential SCADA features and alarms available in POD.
